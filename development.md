npm install --save-dev localtunnel

"scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev --turbopack",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "tunnel": "npx localtunnel --port 3000"
  }

How to Use It:

    Start your development server using npm run dev (or yarn dev if using Yarn).

npm run dev

This will start your Next.js app locally on http://localhost:3000.

Expose your local server with LocalTunnel in a separate terminal window.

    npm run tunnel

    This will create a public URL, such as https://xyz123.loca.lt, which will forward requests to http://localhost:3000.

Optional: Customize the Subdomain

If you'd like a custom subdomain for the tunnel, you can modify the tunnel script like this:

"tunnel": "npx localtunnel --port 3000 --subdomain mycustomsubdomain"

 Cron Job Service

Since Vercel doesnâ€™t support cron jobs directly, you need to use an external service to trigger your API route periodically. Below are a few options:
Option 1: cron-job.org

    Go to cron-job.org and sign up.
    Set up a new cron job with the following settings:
        URL: https://your-vercel-url.com/api/cleanupTags (use your Vercel domain and replace your-vercel-url.com with your actual Vercel URL)
        Frequency: Set to Once a week (or every Sunday midnight, etc.)
        Request Method: GET
        Add headers (if required, like Authorization token).

Option 2: EasyCron

    Go to EasyCron and set up a cron job that calls your API route every week.
    Provide the URL of your Vercel API route (/api/cleanupTags).

Option 3: AWS Lambda (or Google Cloud Functions)

If you prefer to use a cloud function to run the cron job, you can use AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions. These cloud providers offer scheduled tasks (cron jobs) that you can set up to trigger your Vercel API route.

For example, in AWS Lambda:

    Create a function in AWS Lambda that calls your Vercel API endpoint (https://your-vercel-url.com/api/cleanupTags).
    Use Amazon CloudWatch to schedule the Lambda function to run once a week.
